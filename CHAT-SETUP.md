# Crew chat setup

The Chat tab keeps its messages in Google Firebase (Firestore). The free Spark plan
covers a job crew many times over (50,000 reads and 20,000 writes a day) and never
pauses. Until `chat-config.js` is filled in, the tab just says chat isn't switched on yet.

**Already set up:** this app uses the same Firebase project as the Zero Rd app, in its own room
(`waring-crew` in `chat-config.js`), so nothing below is needed unless you want a separate project.

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com, **Create a project** (any name, e.g.
   `waring-chat`). Google Analytics is not needed.
2. **Build > Authentication > Get started > Sign-in method**: enable **Anonymous**.
3. **Build > Firestore Database > Create database**: pick a location near you, start in
   **production mode**.
4. In Firestore, open the **Rules** tab, replace everything with the contents of
   [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules), and press **Publish**.
5. **Project settings** (gear icon) > **General** > **Your apps** > the web icon `</>`.
   Register an app (no Hosting needed). Copy the `firebaseConfig` object it shows.
6. In `chat-config.js`, replace `firebase: null,` with `firebase: { …the pasted object… },`
   then commit to main and bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` so phones pick up the change.

Contractors open the Chat tab, enter their name and trade once, and post. Everyone with
the app sees every message; the tab shows an unread count. A question asked right after
picking something on a sheet is tagged with it (e.g. "E-1 · R12").

Optional hardening: in Google Cloud console > APIs & Services > Credentials, restrict the
Browser API key to your app's web address (HTTP referrers).

To start a fresh conversation for a new phase, change `room` in `chat-config.js`.
Old messages can be deleted in the Firestore console under `rooms/<room>/messages`.

## Open items

Each sheet's **Open items** list uses the same Firebase project. Anyone can tick an item to
resolve it (it's struck through for everyone, with who resolved it and when) and untick it to
reopen it, and anyone can add a new item to a sheet's list, or comment on a picked item from its card
(the comment becomes an open item on that item until resolved); only its author can delete it.
Added items live in `rooms/<room>/items` and resolutions in `rooms/<room>/done`. When
`firestore.rules` changes, paste it into the Firestore **Rules** tab again and press **Publish**,
or the new writes are refused with `permission-denied`.
